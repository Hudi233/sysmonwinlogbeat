# Welcome to Winlogbeat 6.5.4

Winlogbeat ships Windows event logs to Elasticsearch or Logstash.

## Getting Started

To get started with Winlogbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Winlogbeat with:

     ./winlogbeat -c winlogbeat.yml -e

This will start Winlogbeat and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Winlogbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./winlogbeat setup -e
